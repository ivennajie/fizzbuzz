sololearn fizzbuzz project

The given code solves FizzBuzz problems and uses the words 
"Solo" and "Learn" instead of "Fizz" and "Buzz".

It takes an input n and outputs the numbers from 1 to n.

For each multiple of 3, print "Solo" instead of the number.

For each multiple of 5, print "Learn" instead of the number.

For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, output "SoloLearn".

The code will skip the even numbers and the logic only applies to 
odd numbers in the range.
